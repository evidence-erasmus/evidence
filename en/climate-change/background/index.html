What is Climate Change, and which are its causes?</h2><p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures (Figure 1). Specifically, CO₂ traps the longwave radiation given off by the planet. The trapping of the long wave radiation is dictated by quantum mechanics. The two oxygen atoms in CO₂ vibrate with the carbon atom in the center, and the frequency of this vibration coincides with some of the infrared wavelengths of the long wave radiation. When the frequency of the radiation from the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere coincides with the frequency of CO₂ vibration, the radiation is absorbed by CO₂, converted to heat by collision with other air molecules, and then returned to the surface. As a result of this trapping, the outgoing longwave radiation is reduced by increasing CO₂. Not as much heat is escaping to balance the net incoming solar radiation. As a result, there is excess heat energy on the planet, i.e., the system is out of energy balance. As CO₂ is increasing with time, the infrared blanket is becoming thicker, and the planet is accumulating this excess energy.</p><figure class="not-prose m-0 border-slate-300 border bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-4"><img src="https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/c-change__the-greenhouse-effect.webp" loading="lazy" data-nuxt-img class="block"><figcaption class="block text-sm text-center italic mt-4 w-full"><!--[--><b>Figure 1.</b> A simplified diagram illustrating the greenhouse effect <!--]--></figcaption><p class="block text-xs w-full text-center text-slate-400 break-words">From Le Treut et al., 2007</p></figure><p><b>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</b></p><dl><dt class="font-bold">Water vapor:</dt><dd>The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as feedback to the climate.

However, other factors, such as changing temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints, may more than counteract any potential increase in yield. If optimal temperature ranges for some crops are exceeded, earlier possible gains in yield may be reduced or reversed altogether. </li><li> Climate extremes, such as droughts, floods and extreme temperatures, can lead to crop losses and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide.

Climate Change: A socio-scientific and controversial issue</h2><p>In the history of Science, there have been, and there are many examples where contradictory views on specific scientific issues were spread to the general population. Climate change is one example where people and groups take and defend different positions on it. Even though climate science has now firmly established that global warming is occurring, that human activities contribute to this warming, and that current and future warming portend negative impacts on both ecological and social systems (National Research Council, 2010), a significant portion of the American public remains ambivalent or unconcerned (Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-Renouf, &amp; Hmielowski, 2012) and many policymakers (especially in the United States) deny the necessity of taking steps to reduce carbon emissions (Brownstein, 2010).</p><p>Climate science denials do not accept evidence supporting climate change, humanity&#39;s role in causing recent global warming, and/or the severity of climate impacts. Scepticism, contrarianism, dismissal, dissent, doubt, or anti-climate change are some terms that have been used to characterize climate science denials (Cook, 2017).</p><p>Climate misinformation is the reason for public misconceptions about climate change (McCright and Dunlap, 2010). Therefore, many questions (e.g. (1) Is an increase in the Earth&#39;s temperature causing an increase in carbon dioxide or is an increase in carbon dioxide causing an increase in the Earth&#39;s temperature? (2) Do human activities produce equal, less or more carbon dioxide than natural processes? (3) Does the climate change over time? If yes, is climate change a temporary change like the previous ones? (4) Are the mass extinctions of species nowadays a result of climate change or a common occurrence over the years?) that concern the citizens who are worried about the future of the planet and the new generations. As noted in the next contribution, the mass media play a central role in debates over climate science and policy making. Maxwell Boykoff draws on his long experience in analyzing how the media represent climate change to provide an analysis of the multiple factors that contribute to &quot;outlier voices&quot;—sceptics, contrarians, and denialists—receiving unwarranted media visibility and thus influencing policy debates.</p><section class="e-card mt-8"><h4 class="mt-2">References</h4><ul class="text-sm break-all"><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=u9KxE4Kv9A8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=u9KxE4Kv9A8</a></li><li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274306932_Climate_Change_Skepticism_and_Denial_An_Introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274306932_Climate_Change_Skepticism_and_Denial_An_Introduction</a></li><li><b>Karakas, L.

The Global Warming Petition Project is the most prevalent form of this technique within climate misinformation, featuring 31,000 signatories of an online petition dissenting against human-caused global warming. However, 99.9% of the signatories, while holding a science degree, possess no expertise in climate science.

Climate denialist arguments typically contain fatal logical flaws. There are three classes of logical fallacies found in climate misinformation: <ul><li> fallacies of relevance (where the premises are irrelevant to the conclusion), </li><li> scope (where not all relevant evidence is considered), and </li><li> presumption (where the argument contains false premises). </li></ul></dd><dt class="font-bold mt-4"> Impossible expectations: </dt><dd> This involves demanding unrealistic levels of proof or misrepresenting the nature of scientific uncertainty.

Warming helps the poor.&quot;</i><br> (John MacArthur) <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTlYl8E_B14&amp;t=353s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTlYl8E_B14&amp;t=353s</a></p><div class="shadow-md rounded-lg border bg-white px-8 py-4 border-l-8 border-sky-500 my-8"><div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" class="icon float-left mr-4 text-sky-500" style="" width="64px" height="64px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-v-cf1ec82f><path fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 21h14M6 18h2m-1 0v3m2-10l3 3l6-6l-3-3zm1.5 1.5L9 14m8-11l3 3m-8 15a6 6 0 0 0 3.715-10.712"/></svg><div class="font-Heading"><!--[--><div><h3 class="mt-6 pt-3 mb-10">Scientific View considering Myth 6:</h3><p class="text-2xl"> Poverty is increased by climate change and not by the actions to mitigate it. </p><p class="text-2xl"><i>“The impacts of climate change, and the vulnerability of poor communities to climate change, vary greatly, but generally, climate change is superimposed on existing vulnerabilities. Climate change will further reduce access to drinking water, negatively affect the health of poor people, and will pose a real threat to food security in many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In some areas where livelihood choices are limited, decreasing crop yields threaten famines, or where loss of landmass in coastal areas is anticipated, migration might be the only solution. The macroeconomic costs of the impacts of climate change are highly uncertain, but very likely have the potential to threaten development in many countries. Therefore, the task ahead is to increase the adaptive capacity of affected poor communities and countries. <br> This decision to focus on adaptation is deliberate and is taken with the understanding that adaptation cannot replace mitigation efforts. The magnitude and rate of climate change will strongly depend on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere. The higher the concentrations of GHGs, the higher the likelihood of irreversible and grave damage to human and biological systems. Therefore, adaptation is only one part of the solution. Mitigation of climate change by limiting greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere is the indispensable other part.”</i></p></div><!--]--></div></div></div><p> Students investigating Myth 6 during the Guided Inquiry option are studying evidence about the economic benefits switching to the use of renewable electricity, the impending effects of using different energy sources and finally the information given about the jobs that will result from the exploitation of renewable energy sources.
