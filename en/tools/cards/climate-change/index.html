These were the worst affected by record-breaking temperatures that triggered mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017,” said Professor Terry Hughes, co-author of the study. Loss of table-shaped corals will also reduce fish abundance. Hughes added that the Great Barrier Reef&#39;s ability to recover was compromised as there are fewer large breeding corals. “A vibrant coral population has millions of small, baby corals, as well as many large ones — the big mamas who produce most of the larvae,” he said. “Our results show the ability of the Great Barrier Reef to recover — its resilience — is compromised compared to the past, because there are fewer babies, and fewer large breeding adults,” he added.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Story 1</div></div><div lang="en" class="flex flex-col justify-start items-center relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid break-word print:shadow-none border-green-500 w-[89mm] h-[146mm] max-h-[89mm] min-h-[146mm] overflow-hidden" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/card_c-change_polar-bears.webp); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-0 w-full"></div><h3 class="bg-white text-center text-[13pt] leading-none mt-0 mb-0 px-[2mm] py-[0.5mm] rounded-t" style="transform:translateY(-5mm);">Polar bears</h3><!--[--><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[1mm] -mt-[3mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;">A starved 16 year old male polar bear found dead in Svalbard. Dr Ian Stirling, who has studied the bears for almost 40 years and examined the animal said, “From his lying position in death the bear appears to simply have starved and died where he dropped. He had no external suggestion of any remaining fat, having been reduced to little more than skin and bone.” The bear had been examined by scientists from the Norwegian Polar Institute in April in the southern part of Svalbard, an Arctic island archipelago, and appeared healthy. The same bear had been captured in the same area in previous years, suggesting that the discovery of its body, 250 km away in northern Svalbard in July, represented an unusual movement away from its normal range. The bear probably followed the fjords inland as it trekked north, meaning it may have walked double or treble that distance. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park said 16 years was not particularly old for a wild male polar bear, which usually live into their early 20s. “There may have been some underlying disease, but I would be surprised if this was anything other than starvation,” he said.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Story 2</div></div><div lang="en" class="flex flex-col justify-start items-center relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid break-word print:shadow-none border-green-500 w-[89mm] h-[146mm] max-h-[89mm] min-h-[146mm] overflow-hidden" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/card_c-change_turtles.webp); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-0 w-full"></div><h3 class="bg-white text-center text-[13pt] leading-none mt-0 mb-0 px-[2mm] py-[0.5mm] rounded-t" style="transform:translateY(-5mm);">Baby turtles</h3><!--[--><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[1mm] -mt-[3mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;">“In terms of sea turtle gender-ratio, the beaches at Playa Grande on Costa Rica’s Pacific coast are already producing nests that are 70 percent to 90 percent female, depending on the year.

But some scientists predict that a changing climate will also change how our seasons are arranged. Instead of four seasons of equal length, the year will be dominated by just two seasons: winter and summer. Spring and fall will become short, transitional periods in April and October, with most of the year falling into more extreme hot and cold temperatures. Research has shown that seasonal warming happens at an uneven pace across the United States, with winter temperatures rising faster than summer temperatures. As the recent polar vortex shows, many cities still experience extremely low temperatures. However, the average number of days with below-freezing temperatures is decreasing each winter. Cities across the country, especially in the southern states and the Pacific Northwest, are predicted to lose up to two full months of sub-freezing temperatures by 2050.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Story 6</div></div><!--]--></section><h2 class="text-2xl print:break-before-page">Info cards</h2><section class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 mb-10 mt-5 print:flex print:flex-wrap print:gap-2"><!--[--><div lang="en" class="flex flex-col justify-start items-center relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid break-word print:shadow-none border-blue-500 w-[89mm] h-[146mm] max-h-[89mm] min-h-[146mm] overflow-hidden" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/card_c-change_coral-reefs.webp); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-0 w-full"></div><h3 class="bg-white text-center text-[13pt] leading-none mt-0 mb-0 px-[2mm] py-[0.5mm] rounded-t" style="transform:translateY(-5mm);">Coral reefs</h3><!--[--><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[1mm] -mt-[3mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;">Warm-water coral reefs host a wide variety of marine life and are very important for tropical fisheries and other marine and human systems. They are particularly vulnerable since they can suffer high mortalities when water temperatures persist above a threshold of between 1°C–2°C above the normal range. Such conditions occurred in many tropical seas between 2015 and 2017 and resulted in extensive coral bleaching when the coral animal hosts ejected the algal partners upon which they depend. After mass coral mortalities due to bleaching, reef recovery typically takes at least 10–15 years. Corals are also very sensitive to rising acidity, as it is difficult for them to create and maintain the skeletal structures needed for their support and protection. Corals provide vital fish spawning habitat and support for thousands of marine species. EPA’s Climate Change in the United States: Benefits of Global Action states that without action on climate change, dramatic loss of shallow coral cover is predicted to occur. For example, coral cover in Hawaii is projected to decline from 38% (current coral cover) to approximately 5% by 2050 without significant global action on climate change.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info 1</div></div><div lang="en" class="flex flex-col justify-start items-center relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid break-word print:shadow-none border-blue-500 w-[89mm] h-[146mm] max-h-[89mm] min-h-[146mm] overflow-hidden" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/card_c-change_polar-bears.webp); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-0 w-full"></div><h3 class="bg-white text-center text-[13pt] leading-none mt-0 mb-0 px-[2mm] py-[0.5mm] rounded-t" style="transform:translateY(-5mm);">Polar bears</h3><!--[--><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[1mm] -mt-[3mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;">Polar bears give birth and hunt on sea ice and they need it to travel from one region to another. Survival of mothers and cubs in the spring depends on the mothers’ hunting success, which, in turn, depends on the stability and extent of sea ice. Less winter sea ice means that female polar bears have to go longer without food, which impacts their fat stores, and, in turn, their reproductive success. Complete loss of summer sea-ice cover, which may occur in the course of this century, could threaten the survival of polar bears as a species or force them to adopt a land-based summer lifestyle. Living on land would not be without risks due to competition with other predators, possible cross-breeding with brown or grizzly bears, and interactions with humans. Throughout the Arctic, polar bear populations are projected to decline by 30% by 2050, according to the World Wildlife Federation. A study published in 2020 took a detailed look at which polar bear populations are most at risk over this century. If greenhouse gas emissions remain high, cubs will be at risk in 12 out of the 13 bear populations that the researchers studied by the end of this century.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info 2</div></div><div lang="en" class="flex flex-col justify-start items-center relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid break-word print:shadow-none border-blue-500 w-[89mm] h-[146mm] max-h-[89mm] min-h-[146mm] overflow-hidden" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/card_c-change_turtles.webp); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-0 w-full"></div><h3 class="bg-white text-center text-[13pt] leading-none mt-0 mb-0 px-[2mm] py-[0.5mm] rounded-t" style="transform:translateY(-5mm);">Baby turtles</h3><!--[--><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[1mm] -mt-[3mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;">Climate change affects, and will increasingly affect sea and land temperatures. This is particularly important to turtles as their development is intricately linked to temperature. The temperature of the sand at the nesting site affects the resultant sex of the baby turtle embryos: a temperature of ≤ 28˚C results in males; 30˚C means there are equal chances of the turtle being either male or female; and ≥ 32˚C results in females. As temperatures are predicted to rise, there is a growing concern, and already some evidence, that too many females will be born, skewing sex ratios and eventually reaching a situation whereby there are not enough males for the successful reproduction of the population. This phenomenon of skewed sex ratios is known, fittingly, as the ‘feminization’ of embryos. Another future scenario is one where the sand temperatures on the nesting beach are too high for the proper development of the embryos. Nest temperatures above 34˚C are considered to increase the probability of hatchling mutations, in many cases resulting in the hatchlings’ inability to reach adulthood.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info 3</div></div><div lang="en" class="flex flex-col justify-start items-center relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid break-word print:shadow-none border-blue-500 w-[89mm] h-[146mm] max-h-[89mm] min-h-[146mm] overflow-hidden" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/card_c-change_floods.webp); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-0 w-full"></div><h3 class="bg-white text-center text-[13pt] leading-none mt-0 mb-0 px-[2mm] py-[0.5mm] rounded-t" style="transform:translateY(-5mm);">Floods</h3><!--[--><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[1mm] -mt-[3mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;">As climate change warms up the atmosphere, the air can hold 7% more water vapour for every one-degree Celsius rise in temperature. When this air rapidly cools, water vapour turns into droplets which join together to form heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall over a short period of time can cause flash floods, or moderate rainfall over several days can overflow rivers or dams. Countries that have been dealing with high water levels for many years have had the time to adapt – for example, the Netherlands, which has created the world’s most sophisticated flood barriers. But historically, regions that haven&#39;t had to deal with such heavy rains may not have adapted, making them more vulnerable to dangerous flooding. Low-income countries with poor infrastructures may be less equipped to prepare for and prevent flooding such as Bangladesh, Haiti and Vietnam. Increasing temperatures are also melting polar ice caps, which pose significant threats to coastal towns and cities. Antarctica has lost about 3 trillion tonnes of ice in the last 25 years causing global seas to rise by 8mm. In the future, sea levels could rise as much as 5 metres.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info 4</div></div><div lang="en" class="flex flex-col justify-start items-center relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid break-word print:shadow-none border-blue-500 w-[89mm] h-[146mm] max-h-[89mm] min-h-[146mm] overflow-hidden" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/card_c-change_pests.webp); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-0 w-full"></div><h3 class="bg-white text-center text-[13pt] leading-none mt-0 mb-0 px-[2mm] py-[0.5mm] rounded-t" style="transform:translateY(-5mm);">Pests</h3><!--[--><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[1mm] -mt-[3mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;">Climate change is one factor driving the spread of pests and diseases. Climate change can affect the population size, survival rate and geographical distribution of pests, and the intensity, development and geographical distribution of diseases. Temperature and rainfall are the big drivers of shifts in how and where pests and diseases spread, according to experts. «In general, an increase in temperature and precipitation levels favours the growth and distribution of most pest species by providing a warm and humid environment and providing necessary moisture for their growth,» says Tek Sapkota, agricultural systems and climate change scientist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center. «However, when temperatures and precipitation levels get too high, this can slow the growth and reproduction of some pest species and destroy them by washing their eggs and larvae off the host plant», he explains. This would explain why many pests are moving away from the tropics towards more temperate areas. Pests like warmer temperatures – but up to a point. If it is too hot, populations grow more slowly. Since temperate regions are not currently at the optimal temperature for pests, populations are expected to grow more quickly in these areas as they warm up.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info 5</div></div><div lang="en" class="flex flex-col justify-start items-center relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid break-word print:shadow-none border-blue-500 w-[89mm] h-[146mm] max-h-[89mm] min-h-[146mm] overflow-hidden" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/card_c-change_four-seasons.webp); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-0 w-full"></div><h3 class="bg-white text-center text-[13pt] leading-none mt-0 mb-0 px-[2mm] py-[0.5mm] rounded-t" style="transform:translateY(-5mm);">Four seasons</h3><!--[--><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[1mm] -mt-[3mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;">Summers in the Northern Hemisphere could last nearly six months by the year 2100 if global warming continues unchecked, according to a recent study that examined how climate change is affecting the pattern and duration of Earth&#39;s seasons. The study, published last month in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that climate change is making summers hotter and longer while shrinking the three other seasons. Scientists say the irregularities could have a range of serious implications, affecting human health and agriculture to the environment. “This is the biological clock for every living thing,” said the study&#39;s lead author, Yuping Guan. “People argue about a temperature rise of 2 degrees or 3 degrees, but global warming changing the seasons is something everyone can understand.” Guan and his colleagues combed through daily climate data from 1952 to 2011 to pinpoint the start and end of each season in the Northern Hemisphere. They found that over the nearly 60-year period, summers grew from an average of 78 to 95 days long. Winters, on average, shortened from 76 to 73 days, and the spring and autumn seasons similarly contracted. On average, the spring seasons shrank from 124 days to 115 days, and autumns shortened from 87 days to 82 days.</p><!--]--><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info 6</div></div><!--]--></section></div><div class="e-card my-8 md:my-0 md:fixed md:right-4 md:top-24 md:w-60 print:hidden"><p class="italic mt-0 p-0">You can print this page or save as a pdf file</p><button class="mt-4 btn btn-rounded btn-secondary text-white uppercase no-underline"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" class="icon" style="" width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-v-c3ad5561><path fill="currentColor" d="M8 21q-.825 0-1.412-.587T6 19v-2H4q-.825 0-1.412-.587T2 15v-4q0-1.275.875-2.137T5 8h14q1.275 0 2.138.863T22 11v4q0 .825-.587 1.413T20 17h-2v2q0 .825-.587 1.413T16 21zm-4-6h2q0-.825.588-1.412T8 13h8q.825 0 1.413.588T18 15h2v-4q0-.425-.288-.712T19 10H5q-.425 0-.712.288T4 11zm12-7V5H8v3H6V5q0-.825.588-1.412T8 3h8q.825 0 1.413.588T18 5v3zm2 4.5q.425 0 .713-.288T19 11.5q0-.425-.288-.712T18 10.5q-.425 0-.712.288T17 11.5q0 .425.288.713T18 12.5M16 19v-4H8v4zM4 10h16z"/></svg> Print</button></div></div><!--]--></div></div></div><script type="application/json" id="__NUXT_DATA__" data-ssr="true">[["Reactive",1],{"data":2,"state":3,"_errors":10,"serverRendered":11,"path":12,"prerenderedAt":13,"pinia":14},{},{"$sicons":4},{"material-symbols:print-outline-rounded":5},{"left":6,"top":6,"width":7,"height":7,"rotate":6,"vFlip":8,"hFlip":8,"body":9},0,24,false,"\u003Cpath fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M8 21q-.825 0-1.412-.587T6 19v-2H4q-.825 0-1.412-.587T2 15v-4q0-1.275.875-2.137T5 8h14q1.275 0 2.138.863T22 11v4q0 .825-.587 1.413T20 17h-2v2q0 .825-.587 1.413T16 21zm-4-6h2q0-.825.588-1.412T8 13h8q.825 0 1.413.588T18 15h2v-4q0-.425-.288-.712T19 10H5q-.425 0-.712.288T4 11zm12-7V5H8v3H6V5q0-.825.588-1.412T8 3h8q.825 0 1.413.588T18 5v3zm2 4.5q.425 0 .713-.288T19 11.5q0-.425-.288-.712T18 10.5q-.425 0-.712.288T17 11.5q0 .425.288.713T18 12.5M16 19v-4H8v4zM4 10h16z\"/>",{},true,"/en/tools/cards/climate-change",1704794366425,{}]</script><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{persistedState:{storage:"cookies",debug:false,cookieOptions:{}},i18n:{experimental:{jsTsFormatResource:false},baseUrl:"/evidence/"}},app:{baseURL:"/evidence/",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script><script type="module" src="/evidence/_nuxt/entry.fb7445f3.js" crossorigin></script></body>
