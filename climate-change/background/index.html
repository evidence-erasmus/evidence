id="s-1"><h2 id="s-1-title">1. What is Climate Change, and which are its causes?</h2><p> In simple terms, Climate Change can be defined as the global phenomenon of climate transformation, characterized by the changes in the usual climate of the planet (regarding temperature, precipitation, and wind) that are especially caused by human activities. For a more scientific definition, we can adopt NASA’s definition of climate change as “a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels, which add heat-trapping gases to Earth’s atmosphere. These phenomena include the increased temperature trends described by global warming, but also encompass changes such as sea-level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant blooming; and extreme weather events”. Nowadays, many activists, scientists, authors and politicians argue that we should substitute the term ‘climate change’ with the term ‘climate crisis’, in these sense that “Climate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the overall situation; We sould use climate emergency or climate crisis instead to describe the broader impact of climate change” (Sophie Zeldin O-Neil, columnist in ‘The Guardian’ newspaper). </p><p> But, how climate change is happening? To explain it, is necessary to say few words about the “greenhouse effect”. </p><p> Greenhouse effect it is the natural process that warms the Earth’s surface. It is called the greenhouse effect because the exchange of incoming and outgoing radiation that warms the planet works in a similar way to a greenhouse. As a greenhouse is constructed of glass, it allows sunlight to penetrate the exterior and warm the air and plants inside. The heat that isn’t absorbed by plants is trapped by the glass and can’t escape. Throughout daylight hours, sunlight keeps coming through the glass, adding more and more heat energy so the inside gets warmer and warmer (and continues to stay warm after the sun sets). </p><p> The Earth and the Sun work in a similar fashion (on a much more massive scale and a different physical process). The sun shines through the Earth’s atmosphere and the earth’s surface warms up. Some of the Sun’s energy is reflected directly back to space, the rest is absorbed by land, ocean, and the atmosphere and it is transformed into heat. The heat that gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and other “greenhouse gases” trap would otherwise escape Earth’s atmosphere. In the right proportion, these gases do a critical job ensuring the atmosphere holds onto enough heat to support every kind of life on the planet. Without them, the Earth would lose so much heat that life as we know it would be impossible. Although the greenhouse effect is a naturally occurring phenomenon, the effect could be intensified by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as the result of human activity. In that case the greenhouse gases trap too much of the sun’s energy as heat and upset the natural systems that regulate our climate. Things keep getting hotter and hotter and we start seeing more and more extreme weather and other impacts. Even small changes in the global average temperature can cause major and dangerous shifts in climate and weather. Just consider the difference between 0 and 1 degrees Celsius– that one degree means the difference between ice and water. </p><p><b>Here is some information of the most common greenhouse gases:</b></p><dl><dt class="font-bold">Water vapor:</dt><dd>Water vapour is the biggest overall contributor to the greenhouse effect. However, almost all the water vapour in the atmosphere comes from natural processes. </dd><dt class="font-bold">Carbon dioxide (CO₂):</dt><dd>A minor but essential component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions but also from human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and most importantly fossil fuels burning. Humans have increased atmospheric CO₂ concentration by 48% since the Industrial Revolution began.</dd><dt class="font-bold">Methane:</dt><dd>It is produced through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture (e.g. rice cultivation), and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. It is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.</dd><dt class="font-bold">Nitrous oxide:</dt><dd> It is produced by soil cultivation practices, commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.</dd><dt class="font-bold">Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):</dt><dd>Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in several applications but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.</dd></dl><section class="e-card mt-8"><h4 class="mt-2">References</h4><ul class="text-sm break-all"><li><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change</a></li><li><a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/about/networks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gml.noaa.gov/about/networks.html</a></li><li><a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-1-3-figure-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-1-3-figure-1.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=3JX-ioSmNW8 " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=3JX-ioSmNW8</a></li><li><b>Ramanathan, V.</b>, <b>Feng, Y.</b> (2009).

What are the effects of Climate Change?</h2><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and others, refer that the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change.</p><p><b>The effects of climate change vary and include the following:</b></p><ul><li> Rising global temperature: Given the enormous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes massive heat energy to raise Earth’s average yearly surface temperature by even a small amount.

However, other factors, such as changing temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints, may more than counteract any potential increase in yield. If optimal temperature ranges for some crops are exceeded, earlier possible gains in yield may be reduced or reversed altogether. </li><li> Climate extremes, such as droughts, floods and extreme temperatures, can lead to crop losses and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide.

Many species are approaching—or have already reached—the limit of where they can go to find hospitable climates. In the polar regions, animals like polar bears that live on polar ice are now struggling to survive as that ice melts. </li><li> Warming ocean temperatures are melting polar ice, shifting ocean currents and fish migrations, leading to coral bleaching and die-off.

Climate denialists’ arguments typically contain fatal logical flaws.

This extinction, which took place 66,000,000 years ago, was attributed to the impact of an asteroid on Earth. Over the years, we have other well-known examples, such as the extinction of mammoths. However, the causes of extinction that have been recorded vary.</p><p>Also, the suggestion that humanity is capable of impacting and disturbing forces of such magnitude is reflective of a self-centered arrogance that is mind-numbing.

Scientists discovered CO₂’s role in warming the planet in the mid-19th century, noted James Renwick, Professor, Victoria University of Wellington, in a previous review of a similar claim. “Through the past 2.6 million years, the period of recent ice ages, carbon dioxide has gone up and down in step with temperature, bottoming out at around 180 parts per million in the depths of a “glacial maximum” and peaking at around 280 parts per million in the warmer interglacial periods, he said in the review. “Going back further, CO₂ levels were certainly higher than present, but so were temperatures.” Scientists are confident in the finding that increased CO₂ concentrations are causing Earth’s temperature to rise. As CO₂ and other greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, they trap more of the sun’s energy, leading to warming. “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” the IPCC notes in its Sixth Assessment Report.”</i></p></div><!--]--></div></div></div><p> Students investigating Myth 5 during the Guided Inquiry option are studying evidence about how Carbon affects climate and life on Earth.

Climate change will further reduce access to drinking water, negatively affect the health of poor people, and will pose a real threat to food security in many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In some areas where livelihood choices are limited, decreasing crop yields threaten famines, or where loss of landmass in coastal areas is anticipated, migration might be the only solution. The macroeconomic costs of the impacts of climate change are highly uncertain, but very likely have the potential to threaten development in many countries. Therefore, the task ahead is to increase the adaptive capacity of affected poor communities and countries. <br> This decision to focus on adaptation is deliberate and is taken with the understanding that adaptation cannot replace mitigation efforts. The magnitude and rate of climate change will strongly depend on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere. The higher the concentrations of GHGs, the higher the likelihood of irreversible and grave damage to human and biological systems. Therefore, adaptation is only one part of the solution. Mitigation of climate change by limiting greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere is the indispensable other part.”</i></p></div><!--]--></div></div></div><p> Students investigating Myth 6 during the Guided Inquiry option are studying evidence about the economic benefits switching to the use of renewable electricity, the impending effects of using different energy sources and finally the information given about the jobs that will result from the exploitation of renewable energy sources.
