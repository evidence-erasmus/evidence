In an introductory video, several climate change-related myths are brought up, which are further discussed in groups. Group discussion leads to a myth-busting activity where students look for evidence to falsify or confirm a chosen myth.</p><p data-v-cce29ee9>Two options for the myth-busting activity (Activity 3) are recommended: the open-inquiry option and the guided-inquiry option. The open-inquiry option encourages students to conduct an open investigation of the chosen myth. Students search for any scientific sources and apply their plan of activities to falsify or confirm their myth. The guided-inquiry option involves students to a specific suggested plan of activities, scientific sources to investigate and come up with their findings and conclusions.</p><p data-v-cce29ee9>After investigating their myth, students learn to assess the reliability of information/sources (from science/research databases, popular science, and other media) and/or develop further their experimentation skills. After making conclusions, students prepare to present their findings to their classmates (or different audiences) in a relevant and convincing manner (e.g. by video posts).

Student material is provided with criteria the video should fulfil. These criteria can be used formatively for self-assessment by students during the process and for peer assessment when presenting the video and answering the questions of their peers and the teacher (Activity 5). For the last, students can use the following assessment tool to give feedback to the other groups. The teacher could provide each group with summary feedback on their video presentation (suggestion: each group could access only their feedback, not the others).
