Are those claims warranted?</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 2:</span> Infant immune systems cannot handle multiple vaccines.</h3><p>A few days after the birth as well as some weeks/months later, several different vaccines are injected into a baby. The question is if this can be handled by an infant&#39;s body?</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 3:</span> Immunity acquired through a disease is a better choice than immunity acquired through vaccination.</h3><p>Natural immunity is obtained from exposure to the disease through infection. Whereas vaccine-induced immunity is obtained by introducing a killed or weakened form of the disease organism or mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein or even just a piece of a protein or modified version of a virus that triggers an immune response. Which raises the question of whether they are equal or not.</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 4:</span> Vaccines contain life-threatening substances.</h3><p>Sometimes it has been said that vaccines might contain additives or preservatives, some toxic as mercury, aluminium, formaldehyde, etc. Whether or to what extent are these claims valid?</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 5:</span> Better hygiene and sanitation are responsible for decreased infections, not vaccines.</h3><p>The spread of the disease has been argued to be related to environmental conditions, sanitation, and personal hygiene. During the last two centuries, there has been improvement in all. Same time the number of infections has decreased, and vaccination has increased. But can we say that vaccines do not matter?</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 6:</span> Vaccines can infect the child with the disease it is trying to prevent.</h3><p>Some vaccines (measles, chickenpox, etc.) use weakened forms of the disease organism (live-attenuated vaccines). The question is if this will infect the child?</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 7:</span> We do not need to vaccinate because many countries have low infection rates.</h3><p>As very few people have diseases, there is a very low probability that I will be in contact with those people, or it is improbable that I will travel to areas with higher infection rates. Therefore, some believe we could abandon most vaccines routinely administered to children.</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 8:</span> Soap is as good as alcohol for killing certain viruses (e.g. COVID-19)</h3><p>One option to disinfect is using alcohol, but the other is hashing hands with soap. But are they equally effective?</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 9:</span> Masks are pointless in preventing upper respiratory diseases (e.g. COVID-19).</h3><p>There has been much discussion in society about the effectiveness of wearing masks for preventing droplet diseases. At the same time, this habit has been normality in some, e.g. Asian cultures. Still, what is the scientific evidence behind it? Or is it possible for you to test their effectiveness yourself?</p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 10:</span> Prolonged use of the mask produces hypoxia/Masks can cause carbon dioxide poisoning.</h3><p>It is believed that through the mask, you will get less oxygen. If it is true, then with a limited oxygen supply, there is an increased risk of oxygen lack, called hypoxia. Same time your body releases carbon dioxide that, in very high concentrations, can be toxic. But is this assumption actually true?</p><hr id="activity-3" class="mt-10 mb-40 print:my-10"><h2>Activity 3: Mythbusting</h2>',25),bt=e("br",null,null,-1),gt={class:"e-icon--rounded"},vt={class:"e-icon--rounded"},_t={class:"e-icon--rounded"},wt={class:"e-icon--rounded bg-slate-600"},xt=e("div",null,[n(" Now, consider whether your hypothesis can be tested based only "),e("b",null,"on secondary evidence"),n(" (relying on published material of already conducted experiments) or "),e("b",null,"on your own experiment"),n(".
