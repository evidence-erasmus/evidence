When the flowers of these plants are harvested and dried, you’re left with one of the most common drugs in the world. Cannabis is made up of more than 120 components, which are known as cannabinoids. The two most well-known cannabinoids are cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). CBD is the second most prevalent chemical compound found in cannabis and has recently become more popular as an alternative treatment for a number of conditions. It can be derived from <span class="e-term tooltip underline" data-tip="The term “hemp” is used to mean cannabis that contains 0.3 percent or less THC content by dry weight">hemp</span> or from cannabis. THC is the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.

Its usage and popularity throughout the ages has led to it being branded a super medicine by some, stigmatised as evil in society by others; and many other points of view within that spectrum. In the last decade the legalization of the drug for recreational use in many countries and largely available information on the benefits, have even increased public misconceptions. There is a large set of information available on its risks and vice versa on its benefits. Often the information is given on the Internet without proper references. Subsequently, we will look at what scientists and medical personnel have to say about the most common myths about cannabis usage referring to scientific studies. </p><p> More information about the health effects of cannabis can be found from: <a class="break-all" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxisOjHc0qINFXhWvmdmMAJyjp7V9JmgfWXDhCKeuyk/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxisOjHc0qINFXhWvmdmMAJyjp7V9JmgfWXDhCKeuyk/edit</a></p></section><section id="s-3"><h2 id="s-3t">Myths about drugs</h2><h3 id="myth-1"><span class="text-rose-400">Myth No 1:</span> Cannabis isn’t that dangerous for health </h3><p> It has been argued that cannabis is not that dangerous for health, even beneficial. This myth is widely spread, with the main explanations of other drugs being much more toxic and cannabis usage for healing purposes as an alternative drug in several countries. </p><p> However, according to scientific evidence, cannabis has been associated with many health effects (Figure 2). The most important effects include mental illness <sup><span class="tooltip" data-tip="Paruk S &amp; Burns JK. 2016. Cannabis and mental illness in adolescents: a review.

Nevertheless, this does not mean that if you use cannabis, you will go on to use stronger drugs such as cocaine. But some percentage of cannabis users will do. If we compare the prevalence of cannabis with other drug users, cannabis is much more common in most countries <sup><a href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/stats2021/gps_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[24]</a></sup>. However, based on prevalence alone, we cannot draw connections between long-term usage and the gateway hypothesis. </p><p> However, a 25-year longitudinal study has found the frequency of marijuana use to be significant with other illicit drugs of abuse and dependence – particularly with adolescent-onset use <sup><span class="tooltip" data-tip="Fergusson DM, et al. 2006. Cannabis use and other illicit drug use: testing the cannabis gateway hypothesis. Addiction, 101(4), 556-569.">[25]</span></sup>. Two separate studies of twins have compared whether or not early cannabis use showed subsequent abuse or dependence on other illicit drugs. The findings showed two to five times greater risk than that of a twin who did not use marijuana <sup><span class="tooltip" data-tip="Lynskey MT, et al. 2003.

Cannabis and other illicit drugs: comorbid use and abuse/dependence in males and females. Behavior Genetics, 34(3), 217-228.">[27]</span></sup>. </p><p> Another explanation of gateways and addictions is based on brain neurobiology – decreased reward sensitivity and increased expectation sensitivity overwhelm the brain&#39;s control circuit <sup><span class="tooltip" data-tip="Volkow ND, et al. 2010. Addiction: decreased reward sensitivity and increased expectation sensitivity conspire to overwhelm the brain&#39;s control circuit. Bioessays, 32(9), 748-755.">[28]</span></sup>. In other words, the memory circuit drives reward our expectation and enhance the motivation to consume the drug. In conclusion, the evidence is mixed, but the association seems to be there for many cannabis users. </p><h3 id="myth-7"><span class="text-rose-400">Myth No 7:</span> You cannot overdose on cannabis </h3><p> One cannot die directly from cannabis; however, one can overdose, become physically ill (nausea, vomiting), and experience extreme anxiety, paranoia, and short-term psychosis (loss of touch with reality). These effects can take several hours to go away. An overdose of cannabis does not happen often, but the risk exists if you consume unofficial cannabis products. As usual, one cannot accurately measure your dosage and cannabinoid content. Nevertheless, as the cannabis usage prevalence in most countries is much higher than other drugs, the side effects of cannabis have led to far more emergency room visits than other substances <sup><a href=" https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[29]</a></sup>. </p><p> The overdose can also result in worsening of their psychiatric condition, particularly psychosis: this reflects in paranoia, seeing things, hearing things, delusional thinking. The cannabinoid THC in cannabis can make that worse. Sometimes we end up having to give these people antipsychotic medications to reduce the symptoms and get them comfortable. The other thing people can end up in the ER for is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) <sup><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21665-cannabis-hyperemesis-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[30]</a></sup>. CHS is a condition caused by long-term cannabis use. People who have CHS experience reoccurring episodes of nausea, vomiting, dehydration and abdominal pain, with frequent visits to the emergency department. </p><p> Acute toxicity of recreational cannabis has also been studied in Alaska, the U.S. <sup><span class="tooltip" data-tip="Noble MJ et al. 2019. Acute cannabis toxicity. Clinical Toxicology, 57(8), 735-742.">[31]</span></sup>Neurotoxicity is common after acute cannabis exposures. Children experienced unintentional exposures, particularly within the home and occasionally with major adverse outcomes. Concentrated products such as resins and liquid concentrates were associated with greater toxicity than other cannabis products. Another aspect discussed in scientific literature is medical cannabis effects on opioid overdose and mortality. Here the evidence is really mixed and recently the association have been questioned <sup><span class="tooltip" data-tip="Shover CL et al. 2019.
