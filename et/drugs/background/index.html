When the flowers of these plants are harvested and dried, you’re left with one of the most common drugs in the world. Cannabis is made up of more than 120 components, which are known as cannabinoids. The two most well-known cannabinoids are cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). CBD is the second most prevalent chemical compound found in cannabis and has recently become more popular as an alternative treatment for a number of conditions. It can be derived from <span class="e-term tooltip underline" data-tip="The term “hemp” is used to mean cannabis that contains 0.3 percent or less THC content by dry weight">hemp</span> or from cannabis. THC is the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.

Its usage and popularity throughout the ages has led to it being branded a super medicine by some, stigmatised as evil in society by others; and many other points of view within that spectrum. In the last decade the legalization of the drug for recreational use in many countries and largely available information on the benefits, have even increased public misconceptions. There is a large set of information available on its risks and vice versa on its benefits. Often the information is given on the Internet without proper references. Subsequently, we will look at what scientists and medical personnel have to say about the most common myths about cannabis usage referring to scientific studies. </p><p> More information about the health effects of cannabis can be found from: <a class="break-all" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxisOjHc0qINFXhWvmdmMAJyjp7V9JmgfWXDhCKeuyk/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxisOjHc0qINFXhWvmdmMAJyjp7V9JmgfWXDhCKeuyk/edit</a></p><h2 id="myth-1"><span class="text-rose-400">Myth No 1:</span> Cannabis isn’t that dangerous for health </h2><p> It has been argued that cannabis is not that dangerous for health, even beneficial.

Nevertheless, this does not mean that if you use cannabis, you will go on to use stronger drugs such as cocaine. But some percentage of cannabis users will do. If we compare the prevalence of cannabis with other drug users, cannabis is much more common in most countries <sup><a href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/stats2021/gps_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[24]</a></sup>. However, based on prevalence alone, we cannot draw connections between long-term usage and the gateway hypothesis. </p><p> However, a 25-year longitudinal study has found the frequency of marijuana use to be significant with other illicit drugs of abuse and dependence – particularly with adolescent-onset use <sup><span class="tooltip" data-tip="Fergusson DM, et al. 2006.

In other words, the memory circuit drives reward our expectation and enhance the motivation to consume the drug. In conclusion, the evidence is mixed, but the association seems to be there for many cannabis users. </p><h2 id="myth-7"><span class="text-rose-400">Myth No 7:</span> You cannot overdose on cannabis </h2><p> One cannot die directly from cannabis; however, one can overdose, become physically ill (nausea, vomiting), and experience extreme anxiety, paranoia, and short-term psychosis (loss of touch with reality). These effects can take several hours to go away. An overdose of cannabis does not happen often, but the risk exists if you consume unofficial cannabis products. As usual, one cannot accurately measure your dosage and cannabinoid content. Nevertheless, as the cannabis usage prevalence in most countries is much higher than other drugs, the side effects of cannabis have led to far more emergency room visits than other substances <sup><a href=" https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[29]</a></sup>. </p><p> The overdose can also result in worsening of their psychiatric condition, particularly psychosis: this reflects in paranoia, seeing things, hearing things, delusional thinking. The cannabinoid THC in cannabis can make that worse. Sometimes we end up having to give these people antipsychotic medications to reduce the symptoms and get them comfortable. The other thing people can end up in the ER for is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) <sup><a href=" https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21665-cannabis-hyperemesis-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[30]</a></sup>. CHS is a condition caused by long-term cannabis use. People who have CHS experience reoccurring episodes of nausea, vomiting, dehydration and abdominal pain, with frequent visits to the emergency department. </p><p> Acute toxicity of recreational cannabis has also been studied in Alaska, the U.S. <sup><span class="tooltip" data-tip="Noble MJ et al. 2019. Acute cannabis toxicity. Clinical Toxicology, 57(8), 735-742.">[31]</span></sup>Neurotoxicity is common after acute cannabis exposures.

Of these three accidents, two had no fatalities related to nuclear radiation and Chernobyl had about 50 fatalities immediately related to nuclear radiation <sup><a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-09-2005-chernobyl-the-true-scale-of-the-accident" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[31]</a></sup>. Although a further 4,000 fatalities resulting from cancer might be related to the Chernobyl accident, the overall fatality rate remains lower than that attributed to other forms of energy production. “The death toll from nuclear energy is 442 times fewer relative to brown coal per unit of energy, even with radioactive exposure deaths included <sup><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-thesafest-form-of-energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[32]</a></sup>.” </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 2:</span> Nuclear energy contributes to carbon emissions and thus leads to atmospheric pollution and global warming</h3><p> Nuclear is a low-carbon energy source with one of the smallest carbon footprints. It produces energy by nuclear fission and not chemical burning. However, unlike other low-carbon methods, it can create significant energy. In addition, the energy produced by nuclear reactors is not dependent on the weather conditions like renewables are. They can help meet rising energy demands with the vast amounts of energy they can produce from a very small amount of uranium fuel. Therefore, nuclear energy is a clean and efficient form of energy production that can replace fossil fuels and serve as the primary energy source and a backup for renewables. </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 3:</span> Nuclear waste needs to be stored for 100000 years</h3><p> Most nuclear fuel can be recycled to make new fuel or by-products. A small amount of nuclear waste does need to be stored, but for less than 300 years (not thousands). Over 90% of the waste produced from nuclear power stations is classified as low or intermediate-level waste. That includes things like scrap metal, paper, plastics and clothing. Less than 1% is radioactive for 10,000 years. This portion is not much more radioactive than some things found in nature and can be shielded to protect humans and wildlife. </p><p> Many countries plan for geological disposal of waste when nuclear waste is placed into special containers, which are placed in tunnels and vaults under hundreds of meters of solid rock. </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 4:</span> Nuclear plants emit dangerous amounts of radiation </h3><p> Steel and concrete structures of an operating nuclear power plant block most of the generated radiation. Radiation from nuclear power plants is carefully monitored and does not exceed the level of background radiation that comes from different sources. The sun and stars send a constant stream of cosmic radiation to Earth. The amount (or dose) of cosmic radiation we receive depends on elevation, atmospheric conditions, and the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. All water contains small amounts of dissolved uranium and thorium, and all organic matter (both plant and animal) contains radioactive carbon and potassium. Some of these materials are ingested with food and water, while others (such as radon) are inhaled. </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 5:</span> Exposure to radiation only occurs from a nuclear power station</h3><p> People, plants and animals are constantly exposed to some radiation. It comes from the ground beneath us and the space above us. Radioactive materials (including uranium, thorium, and radium) exist naturally in soil and rock. So-called background radiation is part of our everyday lives. Essentially all air contains radon, which is responsible for most of the dose that people receive each year from natural background sources. We also carry tiny amounts of radioactive isotopes inside our bodies. However, our bodies are adapted to this radiation, and our cells can handle it. Radiation from the nuclear industry is much lower than what occurs naturally. </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 6:</span> We don&#39;t need nuclear power in the EU</h3><p> In the EU is a vast and ongoing demand for electricity. Alongside wind and solar, nuclear is part of the solution for low-carbon electricity. In France, nearly 80% of el is produced by NUCs. While wind and solar energy rely on the weather, nuclear is always able to provide power. In the longer term, nuclear power can be used to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells and synthetic liquid fuels. </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 7:</span> Nuclear plants are ageing and inefficient</h3><p> Plant equipment is continually evaluated to determine what needs to be upgraded or replaced. Nuclear power plants are modern on the inside because most components have been replaced. </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 8:</span> Nuclear power plants can explode</h3><p> It is physically impossible for a modern reactor to explode like a nuclear weapon. The fuel does not have enough uranium to be explosive, and reactors are designed with layers of safety systems and automatic shutdown capabilities. It is not possible for a person to intentionally or unintentionally modify a commercial nuclear reactor to cause an explosion. </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 9:</span> Nuclear waste cannot be safely transported.</h3><p> Used fuel is being safely shipped by truck, rail, and cargo ship today. To date, thousands of shipments have been transported in specially designed casks without any radiation leaks. </p><h3><span class="text-rose-400">Myth 10:</span> Nuclear plant workers are radioactive themselves.</h3><p> All people have internal radiation, mainly from radioactive potassium-40 and carbon-14, inside their bodies from birth and, therefore, are sources of exposure to others. The variation in dose from one person to another is not as significant as that associated with cosmic and terrestrial sources. Nuclear plant workers are not more radioactive than other people. </p></section></div></div><!--]--></div><nav class="flex flex-col items-stretch bg-slate-800 text-white text-sm fixed right-0
