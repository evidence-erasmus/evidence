lively, intelligent, curious boy who was always healthy. Two years ago, at the age of 12, he died suddenly of meningitis at a summer camp. During the holidays, another boy also went down with meningitis but suffered no further consequences. All the youngsters at the camps received a preventive dose of antibiotics. At the hospital, they told us there was a vaccine against the pathogen that killed our son. On top of the tremendous pain of losing my son, it hurts me even more, to think that he would still be alive today if he had been vaccinated.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Story EL 1</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-blue-600 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/🧔); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-[4mm]"></div><!----><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">I was very reluctant to accept the flu vaccination when our family doctor offered it to us this year. Since we retired, my husband has developed heart failure, and we have been vaccinated every year. Still, we caught the flu last year even though we had been vaccinated. This year our doctor offered us the vaccine again, and, as he insisted, we agreed to be vaccinated. He told us this year’s virus was similar to the one that caused the Spanish flu epidemic at the beginning of the last century. Still, a terrible outbreak like that didn’t happen, and neither my husband nor I became ill.

Since she went to preschool, we have been very worried after encountering other parents refusing vaccines for their children suggesting that vaccines are pointless, if not even dangerous. As Anna has not got all the scheduled vaccines, we are afraid she is especially vulnerable when being in the same group with children not vaccinated with the routinely scheduled vaccines.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Story EL 3</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-blue-600 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div style="background:url(https://evidence.onkel.ee/assets/cards/🧔); background-size:cover; background-position:50% 50%;" class="h-[42mm] mb-[4mm]"></div><!----><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">I read a World Health Organisation leaflet at the pediatrician’s surgery. In 1998, about a thousand children suffered paralysis daily due to the polio virus. Most of them lived in the poorest countries. After worldwide vaccination campaigns, in 2000, only 30 children a day suffered paralysis due to polio. When I had my son vaccinated, I felt part of a project.

We detected the first symptoms after the second vaccination. He was irritable, he wouldn’t look at us, he didn’t like being picked up and he was living as if he were alone. We read an article on the internet from the medical journal Lancet that related autism and vaccines. The paediatrician told us the article had been withdrawn because of fraud and many subsequent studies had rejected the relationship between vaccination and autism. The paediatrician also told us that the disease is usually diagnosed at about the same time as children are vaccinated, so some people wrongly believe there is a link between the two things.

To start with there were a few isolated cases, but the epidemic has spread and now a lot of people are ill. Some have been admitted to hospital. The complications of measles in adults can be serious, so the authorities decided that, in order to attend courses, vaccination records had to be presented or students would have to prove they had already had the disease. As vaccines are not compulsory, I don’t believe institutions should invade our privacy in this way.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Story EL 6</div></div><!--]--></section><h2 class="text-2xl print:break-before-page">Info cards EL</h2><section class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 mb-10 mt-5 print:flex print:flex-wrap print:gap-2"><!--[--><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-sky-400 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">Vaccination coverage</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">With the success of vaccines, the seriousness of certain diseases is no longer perceived.

After initial immunization, a booster dose is a re-exposure to the immunizing antigen. It is intended to increase immunity against that antigen back to protective levels after memory against that antigen has declined. For example, tetanus shot boosters are often recommended every ten years.

This ended a disease that killed 35% of the people infected and caused blindness and multiple scars for the survivors.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info EL 14</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-sky-400 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">How is a vaccine developed?</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">Drugs that can become vaccines must be analyzed and tested on cells and animals in studies costing significant amounts of money. If good results are obtained in these tests, the drug company asks the authorities to approve a human clinical trial. Clinical trials are divided into three phases, including many procedures and more tests. Only if the results are positive and the authorities approve the vaccine can the pharmaceutical company sell it.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info EL 15</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-sky-400 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">Vaccines and natural infection</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">Vaccines stimulate the immune system, cause a similar but less intense response to the effect of a natural infection and prevent the disease and its complications in most cases. On the other hand, the price for immunity after natural infection might be pneumonia from chickenpox or pneumococcus, intellectual disability from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), birth defects from rubella, liver cancer from hepatitis B virus, death from measles, etc. If you wanted to gain immunity to measles, for example, by contracting the disease, you would face a 1 in 500 chance of death from your symptoms. In contrast, the number of people who have had severe allergic reactions from an MMR vaccine is less than one-in-one million.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info EL 16</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-sky-400 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">Thiomersal</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">Thiomersal is a compound containing mercury used to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi in vials of vaccines. However, the amount of thiomersal in vaccines is minimal and involves no health risk. A vaccine containing 0.01% thimerosal as a preservative contains roughly the same amount of elemental mercury contained in a small can of tuna fish. Moreover, since 2001, routine vaccines for children under six no longer contain thimerosal. Teens and adults can also request thimerosal-free vaccines. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body quickly compared to methylmercury, which bioaccumulates – so there is also a difference in which form toxic metal is. Nevertheless, COVID-19 vaccines, e.g. do not contain toxins.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info EL 17</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-sky-400 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">Aluminium</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">Certain elements, such as aluminum salts, are added to vaccines because they work as an adjuvant, which means their presence boosts the immune response when you are vaccinated. The small amount of aluminum in some vaccines does not cause any risk. A dose of vaccine contains 0.5 mg of aluminum. At the same time, it is estimated that we ingest 8 mg of food daily without causing any problems. Also, only certain vaccines contain aluminum salts, and new COVID-19 vaccines do not include them.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info EL 18</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-sky-400 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">Measles</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">What effect would measles have if we weren’t vaccinated? Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were significant epidemics every two or three years, causing around 2.6 million deaths yearly. Since then, the figure has fallen, and in 2016 there were 89,780 deaths from measles throughout the world. This brought the figure below 100,000 deaths a year for the first time. If vaccination against the disease ended, we might return to the previous situation.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info EL 19</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-sky-400 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">Vaccines and the immune system</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">Babies and children are exposed to many viruses daily as they play, eat and breathe. These viruses, their proteins, and other substances they secrete act as antigens – in other words, they activate the immune response. The quantity of antigens children fight every day (2,000-6,000) is therefore much higher than the total number of antigens applied through vaccination. Children’s immune systems are prepared to tolerate vaccines well.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info EL 20</div></div><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-sky-400 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">Raising the probability of not becoming infected</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">Based on the data from Los Angeles County, unvaccinated people were about 29 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated, according to a CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US) report in 2021.</p><div class="absolute top-0 left-[3mm] text-[8pt] bg-white px-1 rounded-b shadow">Info EL 21</div></div><!--]--></section><h2 class="text-2xl print:break-before-page">Position cards EL</h2><section class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 mb-10 mt-5 print:flex print:flex-wrap print:gap-2"><!--[--><div lang="el" class="flex flex-col justify-start relative border-4 text-center rounded-lg shadow-md break-inside-avoid print:shadow-none border-amber-500 print:w-[70mm] print:h-[121mm] w-[70mm] h-[121mm]" style="hyphens:auto;"><div class="h-[24mm]"></div><h3 class="text-center text-[14pt] leading-tight mt-0 mb-[4mm] px-[4mm]">Position 1</h3><p class="text-[9pt] m-0 leading-tight text-justify px-[4mm] pb-[4mm] print:font-sans" style="hyphens:auto;hyphenate-limit-chars:5 2 2;">The State establishes a compulsory vaccination schedule for everyone.
