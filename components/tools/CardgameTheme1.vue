A vaccine containing 0.01% thimerosal as a preservative contains roughly the same amount of elemental mercury contained in a small can of tuna fish. Moreover, since 2001, routine vaccines for children under six no longer contain thimerosal. Teens and adults can also request thimerosal-free vaccines. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body quickly compared to methylmercury, which bioaccumulates ‚Äì so there is also a difference in which form toxic metal is.

At the same time, it is estimated that we ingest 8 mg of food daily without causing any problems. Also, only certain vaccines contain aluminum salts, and new COVID-19 vaccines do not include them."

Since then, the figure has fallen, and in 2016 there were 89,780 deaths from measles throughout the world. This brought the figure below 100,000 deaths a year for the first time.
