                <p>In this module, students are invited to falsify (“bust”) or confirm a common myth about climate change. In an <NuxtLink to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbJ7GmgEAAo" target="_blank">introductory video</NuxtLink>, several climate change-related myths are brought up, which are further discussed in groups. Group discussion leads to a myth-busting activity where students look for evidence to falsify or confirm a chosen myth.</p>
                <p>Two options for the myth-busting activity (Activity 3) are recommended: the open-inquiry option and the guided-inquiry option. The open-inquiry option encourages students to conduct an open investigation of the chosen myth. Students search for any scientific sources and apply their plan of activities to falsify or confirm their myth. The guided-inquiry option involves students to a specific suggested plan of activities, scientific sources to investigate and come up with their findings and conclusions.</p>
                <p>After investigating their myth, students learn to assess the reliability of information/sources (from science/research databases, popular science, and other media) and/or develop further their experimentation skills. After making conclusions, students prepare to present their findings to their classmates (or different audiences) in a relevant and convincing manner (e.g. by video posts). The module is finished with an argumentation game where students can make socio-scientific decisions using their scientific knowledge while incorporating it with personal and social values.</p>
                <p>The module consists of the teacher material (teaching suggestions and science background information), the student open-inquiry material (interactive worksheets, tutorials), and the student guided-inquiry material -different for each myth- (videos scenario, specific scientific sources, interactive worksheets, tutorials).</p>

                <p>
                    The module starts with an <NuxtLink to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbJ7GmgEAAo" target="_blank">introductory video</NuxtLink> opening up a few myths about climate change to raise further questions in students rather than giving them immediate answers. It is expected that after watching the video (<NuxtLink to="./climate-change/student#a-1">Activity 1</NuxtLink>), students in groups will feel intrinsically motivated to examine one myth in depth. An intention is to involve students in committing to activities that relate to a better understanding of the issue – an issue seen by students as relevant to their lives, not simply to the curriculum. It draws students' attention to thinking about their prior knowledge and sharing their conceptions and views with peers (<NuxtLink to="./climate-change/student#a-2">Activity 2</NuxtLink>).
                    <br>
                    Also, selected chapters from <NuxtLink to="/climate-change/background">Scientific background information</NuxtLink> can be used for this purpose. In Activity 2, students have to narrow down their chosen myth into a hypothesis that can be falsified/confirmed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <NuxtLink to="./climate-change/student#a-3">Activity 3</NuxtLink> is the myth-busting activity. Two alternative options are proposed for implementing Activity 3 (Figure 2).

                    The teacher could choose which option of Activity 3 students will use by considering their students' cognitive skills and the available teaching time. However, the open-inquiry option is considered the most challenging option for students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As reliability assessment can be a real challenge for students, the material is supplied with a tool for searching and analysing the information. Also, the teacher could explain its use by demonstrating and analysing reliable and less reliable sources as learning examples before the students implement this tool independently.

                    To learn how to communicate their findings, students are guided to produce a video of their experiment as evidence or make a video of their conclusions based on secondary evidence (<NuxtLink to="./climate-change/student#a-4">Activity 4</NuxtLink>). Student material is provided with criteria the video should fulfil. These criteria can be used formatively for self-assessment by students during the process and for peer assessment when presenting the video and answering the questions of their peers and the teacher (<NuxtLink to="./climate-change/student#a-5">Activity 5</NuxtLink>).

                    In the last activity (<NuxtLink to="./climate-change/student#a-6">Activity 6</NuxtLink>), the storyline of the module returns to the introductory video and the presented myths. Based on the lessons learned from the earlier stages, students prepare to make decisions on an individual or group level in a board game with cards where they have an opportunity to juxtapose and reflect on their learned science knowledge and their personal and social values. The rules of play are given in student worksheets. Students need to be instructed shortly before the start to understand the game's general flow.

                    All myths are backed up by Scientific background information, which explains the state-of-the-art science behind them and enables the teacher to get a quick overview of the science covered by the "Climate Change" module but could also be used as learning material for students to recall climate change-related knowledge.

                    Artistic reflections on Climate change by the art school students (see <NuxtLink to="https://www.artsteps.com/view/6411276082afca1aa133e268" target="_blank">virtual exhibition</NuxtLink>) can show alternative ways of exploring related phenomena. They could serve as a point of departure for discussing what the students would wish to learn more in this area.
