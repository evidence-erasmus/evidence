            In the following activity, you are invited to solve a moral dilemma in a case study described below.  The activity enables you to discuss the dilemma in-depth by considering different perspectives and justifications and reflecting on your and your classmates’ thoughts. 
        </p>

        <h3>Phase I (≈15 minutes)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Read carefully through the description of the case.
            </li>
            <li>
                Imagine how you would feel if you were Cris and what decisions you would make if you were in his/her place. You could choose for yourself whether Cris is a boy or a girl. Put yourself in his/her "shoes", see how you would feel, and think about what is happening and what you would do.

            <h3>
                Case
            </h3>
            <p>
                Cris is a 10th-grade student interested in different things, such as playing football and hanging out with friends but also trying to keep up with his/her studies to fulfil (his/her) dream of entering the military academy after high school graduation to study cyber defence. Cris' father is an army officer, and his/her mother is a teacher. They both strongly support Cris' chosen career goal. Cris has a good and long-term friend Marcus who has no particular hobby except computer games that they both often used to play. Things have been going poorly for Marcus during the last two years. His mother has got cancer. As a result, Marcus has taken over the responsibilities of an adult while taking care of himself and, from time to time, his mother. His father does not live with them and very rarely shows up. Cris has tried to keep up Marcus' spirits and help him with studying in basic school, but since entering different high schools, their ways have gone somewhat apart. The more is Cris surprised when (s)he gets a message from Marcus asking him/her to a party organized by his schoolmate. (S)he gladly accepts the invitation because (s)he has felt guilty for not being interested in his/her friend's well-being, though Cris likely knows other people at this party. When arriving at the party, most people feel loud and relaxed, some seemingly unsober. Finally (s)he is happy to find Marcus, after which they start talking about what has happened. As Cris understands, things have worsened for Marcus - he barely has visited school lately. When Cris asks why he says that life entirely sucks. After a long conversation, he also reveals that things are nasty with her mother. The only thing Marcus says that helps him forget all the crap is weed, which his mother grows against her nausea, but he has started to consume himself, too. At some point in the conversation, he also offers some weed to Cris, saying that weed is safe and nobody has ever died from an overdose. Cris is curious about the drug, though (s)he feels against trying it himself/herself. Suddenly, probably because of the noise and neighbours' calls, two police officers and a dog jumped into the middle of the party. In the middle of this, Marcus begs Cris to keep the weed in his/her hands as he already has had that kind of problem with the police.

                    Cris should keep the weed in his/her hands:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Cris should keep it because Marcus has done many nice things to Cris. Now (s)he can "pay" it back.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cris should keep it to avoid his/her friend from getting a criminal penalty, which may lead him even deeper into his personal downfall.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cris should keep it because (s)he cannot disappoint his long-term friend.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cris should keep it as Marcus is not guilty; his life has been just unfair towards him.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Other: ...............................................
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>



                <p>
                    Cris should give the weed back to Marcus:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Cris should give it back not to disappoint his/her parents in case (s)he gets caught with drugs by police.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cris should give it back to Marcus because owning and consuming weed is forbidden and, therefore, illegal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cris should give it back and let Marcus take all the responsibility for what he has done. Narcotics have ruined many people's lives. It is just not right to support their use and propagation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cris should give it back, as trying to keep Marcus from being convicted for a small amount of narcotics may pull him into a more significant narcotics-related affair in the future. He could get a life lesson to avoid dealing with drugs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cris should return it to Marcus because such a criminal friend will be useless.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cris should not keep it because this could result in a criminal record for him/her, which means (s)he is a bad person.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cris should not keep it as this could result in a criminal record for him/her and prevent him/her from entering the military academy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cris should give it back as acting otherwise would not be fair towards him/her being punished for the act that (s)he has not committed. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other: ......................................

                <h3>
                    Phase III: Group discussion I (≈20 min)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In this stage, group members (4-6 students) share their opinion(s) with others and refine their points of view as they hear different arguments and perspectives. It is suggested the RICE approach while discussing:
                </p>
                <p class="first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-blue-500 first-letter:text-xl">
                    Respect for an individual’s contributions, which we can demonstrate by listening to one another’s views. 
                </p>
                <p class="first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-blue-500 first-letter:text-xl">
                    Involvement in the discussion and activities. 
                </p>
                <p class="first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-blue-500 first-letter:text-xl">
                    Confidentiality that personal matters revealed during the discussion are not shared outside the group discussion. 
                </p>
                <p class="first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-blue-500 first-letter:text-xl">
                    Equality, as we acknowledge that everyone’s experience and opinions are equally valid.
                </p>


                <p>
                    After the initial group discussion, evaluate the options by asking the following questions.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Which option best serves the community, not just some members?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Which option leads me to act as the person I want to be? (can be left for individual consideration).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Phase IV (20-40 min)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Consider and write a concluding scene to the story about how Cris could help Marcus (200-400 words). While doing so, please try to use learned knowledge about cannabis.
                </p>
