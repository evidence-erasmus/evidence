            In the following activity, you are invited to solve a moral dilemma in a case study described below. The activity enables you to discuss the dilemma in-depth by considering different perspectives and justifications and reflecting on your and your classmates’ thoughts. 
        </p>

        <h3>
            Phase I (≈15 minutes)
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Read carefully through the description of the case.
            </li>
            <li>
                Imagine how you would feel if you were Cris and what decisions you would make if you were in his/her place. You could choose for yourself whether Cris is a boy or a girl. Put yourself in his/her "shoes", see how you would feel, and think about what is happening and what you would do.

                Case 2
            </h3>

            <p>
                The Lindens and Pines are neighbours. Gert Linden and Sam Pines have been best friends since elementary school when the families started living in the same house, and the children began to study together at the local school. Recently, Gert has worried about his/her mother's increasing interest in alternative treatments. Mother's interest is notably boosted when Gert's younger brother Robert (age 8) is diagnosed with juvenile arthritis. The vivacious Robert finds it difficult to accept a situation where even normal walking causes difficulties due to painful joints. Since the drugs prescribed by the doctor do not seem to help Robert after two months of treatment, the mother starts independent research with the help of Dr Google, finally reaching out to the MMS community. Based on Gert, the mother and then Robert have started using MMS. Robert dislikes its taste and smell, and sometimes it's taking makes him vomit, but because he wants to get well and not disappoint his mother, he has continued to take it along with other medications. Robert's joints have somewhat improved, but Robert has started to complain about frequent stomach aches. Gert is sure that the MMS causes it, but the mother is convinced that if he stops taking the MMS, arthritis will get worse again. Gert complains about the situation to Sam but takes a promise not to tell anyone about it "because otherwise there will be a big problem." After considering, Sam will tell the story to his/her parents. Still, they also advise not to get involved, as the families have been good neighbours, and according to them, Gert's mother has been fearless, working two jobs and raising two children alone.

        <ul>
            <li>
                What are the relevant facts of the case? Can you learn more about the situation? Do you know enough to propose a solution to the problem? Search for relevant information in case you need it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Phase II (≈15 min)
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>You are now provided with different possible solutions for the case and proposed dilemma.</b>
            <br />
            Please read them through and think about the potential solutions and rationality behind them. This is not meant to be a multiple-choice test with one correct answer. Instead, the different responses are included to get you to think about possibilities you may not have considered. Make sure you work alone, as this is about you and needs to be your decision. If you have a different response as given, add it to the “other” field.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Choose 1-3 potential options that seem to be relevant for you.</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Sam should discuss this with a knowledgeable adult (school psychologist, social pedagogue, child protection worker, etc.), as Robert's health may be at risk.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sam shouldn't tell anyone about this because (s)he might lose her/his best friend's trust forever.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sam should not tell anyone about this; it is a family matter and nobody else's business.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sam shouldn't tell anyone about this, as (s)he would lose his parents' trust, and Gerd's mother would probably hate him.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sam should discuss this with a knowledgeable adult (school psychologist, social pedagogue, child protection worker, etc.) because knowingly and intentionally harming a child's health is considered child abuse and is punishable by law.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sam should not tell anyone about this; it is a family matter, and people have the right to privacy.
            </li>
            <li>

        <h3>
            Phase III: Group discussion I (20 min)
        </h3>
        <p>
            In this stage, group members (4-6 students) share their opinion(s) with others and refine their points of view as they hear different arguments and perspectives. It is suggested the RICE approach while discussing:
        </p>

        <p class="first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-blue-500 first-letter:text-xl">
            Respect for an individual’s contributions, which we can demonstrate by listening to one another’s views. 
        </p>
        <p class="first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-blue-500 first-letter:text-xl">
            Involvement in the discussion and activities. 
        </p>
        <p class="first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-blue-500 first-letter:text-xl">
            Confidentiality that personal matters revealed during the discussion are not shared outside the group discussion. 
        </p>
        <p class="first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-blue-500 first-letter:text-xl">
            Equality, as we acknowledge that everyone’s experience and opinions are equally valid.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the initial group discussion, evaluate the options by asking the following questions.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Which option best serves the community, not just some members?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Which option leads me to act as the person I want to be? (can be left for individual consideration).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>
            Phase IV (20-40 min)
        </h3>

        <p>
            Consider and write a concluding scene to the story about how Sam could help Gert (200-400 words). While doing so, please try to use learned knowledge about MMS.
        </p>
