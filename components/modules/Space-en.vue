            <p>
                Space captivates our imagination from earlier childhood. Questions about the infinity of the Universe, extra-terrestrial life and the possibility of space travel to other planets and beyond excite the minds of many youngsters. Children generally have an innate instinct to explore and a solid will to experience and understand. Some of them dream about being space explorers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Space travel has already become achievable for not professional astronauts. Some paying passengers went to the International Space Station (ISS), including Anousheh Ansari, the first Iranian and Muslim woman in space (2006). Commercial programs are established for suborbital flight at a height of about 100 km over the Earth's surface. Orbital tourist flights around the Earth require almost double the height and much more velocity and energy by the spaceship, but they are also envisioned soon. Among our students today may be future professional and amateur space explorers. 
            </p>

            <p>
                However, many misconceptions, myths and conspiracy theories about space travel circulate daily. UFOs that visit us from outer space and the never-mentioned human moon landing are just two examples of those that appear in the media. Incidences of such rumours are still around for a while as the public can observe different kinds of unusual drones more often nowadays, and new human moon landing programmes are announced. The current American "Artemis Project" and Chinese moon program called "Chang Project" seems to start competing to see who will land on the Moon first this time and attract once again public attention to this area. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Many of our students are familiar with spaceship functions through different space games for computers and smartphones and water rocket launching activities in schools or science centres. They know the feeling of short weightlessness from amusement parks or aeroplanes. Some of them probably experienced a tour of the International Space Station (ISS) with the help of a VR application released for free in the Oculus store or have seen a film about ISS in 3D theatre at science museums.
            </p>

            <p>
                The era of space exploration started in 1957 with the launch of the first satellite (Sputnik) to orbit around the Earth. Technology has developed enormously during these years; however, space exploration goes slower than predicted, entails many risks and uncertainties and is accompanied by different technology failures. A recent attempt (January 2023) to launch satellites, for the first time from British soil, using a rocket launch technology developed by Virgin Orbit company, failed to reach orbit, destroying the entire payload of nine satellites. The Virgin company's space tourism division, Virgin Galactic, which has promised since 2004 to begin regular suborbital flights for paying space tourists using similar launching technology, has yet to deliver on that pledge. Virgin's approach is to lift a spacecraft under the wing of a Boeing 747 to about 10000 m altitude and then fire it up. This recent Virgin failure shows once again that space exploration always carries significant risks, particularly in launching spacecraft and returning space missions to the Earth. The issues of dealing with risks and associated moral dilemmas of sending human missions to space are the focus of this module.

                Working with this module, teachers can choose to do some practical activities and demonstrations to explain phenomena, debunk space-related myths or explore common misconceptions when school facilities provide for this. Otherwise, we suggest doing this through evidence collection from reliable sources of scientific and professional information. Students can also use different data collection methods, applying the so-called triangulation principle – increasing the validity of findings by converging information from different sources.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuC4DJElPQrP8BEpdGHT5MZR_30VrDVCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introductory videos</a> (teacher can select among  “Earth Calls Martha”, “3-2-1”, “Where are all the Aliens”, and “Flag in the Wind”), some ideas, conspiracy theories, misconceptions and myths are brought up which are suggested for further discussions in groups. Students are invited to select and explain common space-related myths or misconceptions. Group discussions are expected to lead to evidence collection from reliable data sources to gain deeper insight into a phenomenon and falsify or confirm a chosen myth. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Human space travel will probably attract the special attention of the students. Some biological effects of space travel, such as space motion sickness or Space Adaptation Syndrome (SAS), can be experienced practically on Earth through centrifugation (Sickness Induced by Centrifugation, SIC). However, few of us would probably like to be exposed to centrifuge and simultaneous rotations going from 1G to 3G (or higher) and back to 1G, a part of standard astronaut training. A light version of such an experience is available in some amusement parks as “Insanity Rides 360”. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Most activities suggested in this module will rely on secondary evidence gathered through literature searches and data collected from the internet. Through these activities, students learn to assess the reliability of information sources and make evidence-based arguments. After drawing conclusions, students prepare to present their findings to their classmates (or other audiences) in a relevant and convincing manner (e.g. video posts). The module is finished with a debate roleplay where students can make socio-scientific decisions using their scientific knowledge while incorporating it with personal, moral and social values.
            </p>

            <p>
                The module comprises teacher material (teaching suggestions, science background information) and student material (introductory video, interactive worksheets, fact videos, and a video tutorial).

                Students can be assessed in different ways throughout the module, including science process skills, general competencies, such as argumentation skills, and topic-related content knowledge. Assessments that could be applied in this module:

            <p>
                The module activities can be structured in two parts. The first part (Activities 1-5) concerns work with specific space-related myths, ideas, controversies and issues that could be identified in an introductory video, recalled by the students or suggested by the teacher. The second part (Activity 6) focuses on work with the socio-scientific topic of human space travels that is summed up with the help of a debate game/role-play (see student material moderated by the teacher).
            </p>
            <p>
                After a short introduction, as a warm-up activity, students can, in small groups, think about what questions they would like to ask an astronaut/space researcher if they had a chance (two-three questions per group to be presented). This will allow them to probe their interests and expectations concerning the subject raised in the module. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After watching and selecting an introductory video (Activity 1), students can examine one of the identified myths, misconceptions or issues. Teachers can also introduce here other myths and issues related to space. Students can be encouraged to recall existing understandings about space from their everyday life. The “fact videos” can be used in this step to highlight and broaden space-related topics, concepts, and principles. Selected parts from scientific background information can recur when necessary.

            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMo9WfKeOY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introductory video</a> aims to raise questions and stimulate reflections rather than give students immediate answers. It is expected that after watching the video <b>(Activity 1)</b>, students will get motivated to examine one of the identified myths related to different sources of electromagnetic radiation and explore common fears. Myths and fears can vary between different countries and age groups. Teachers could encourage students to find their ‘own’ myths.
            </p>

            <p>
                The teacher can introduce an expanded view of the radiation spectrum that includes ionising components – from ultraviolet emitted by our Sun to the shorter wavelength and high-energy particles. The intention is to broaden students’ views on the physics of radiation and its applications and attract their attention to some myths related to the different effects of radiation. Students are also encouraged to recall their prior knowledge, including existing understandings in everyday life among people they know, family, and friends, and to share their conceptions and views with peers <b>(Activity 2)</b>. The “fact videos” can be demonstrated in this step to highlight and broaden radiation-related topics, concepts, and principles. Selected chapters from <nuxt-link to="./radiation/background">scientific background information</nuxt-link> can recur when necessary.
            </p>



            <p><b>Activity 2</b> should help students narrow down their chosen myth into a hypothesis/research question that can be confirmed/answered <b>(Activity 3)</b>. Further, this step can be enacted in the following two ways:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Students can choose a myth that can be tested experimentally, collecting evidence through simple qualitative experiments. For example, the level of electromagnetic radiation exposure could be measured with the help of a free smartphone app, e.g. ElectroSmart or similar. ElectroSmart is a Radiofrequency Electromagnetic-Field (EMF) detector (see Figure 2).

                    <p>
                        This app allows measurement of a current exposure using the ElectroSmart Index, indicating if exposure is suiting most people (low or moderate level) or high, that eventually needs some measures to be taken for its reduction. Students can see that increasing distance to the source can decrease (in square rate) the level of exposure. They can also try to use a shield of aluminium foil (on their smartphone) to see a decrease in exposure by shielding. For a variation of this test, see also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asmbgAeJqis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asmbgAeJqis</a>.

                    <p>
                        If you have access to a simple analogue or digital physics tool - an EMF measuring device (see Figure 3), it is possible to measure the radiation emanating from each of your chosen electronic devices: laptop computer, tablet device, smartphone, printer, speakers, TV, remote control, lamp, refrigerator, modem and compare the amounts of radiation from each device.

                        If more advanced (and expensive) EMF measuring tools are available, more sophisticated measurements could be done; see for inspiration: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKPw-dnxZTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKPw-dnxZTo</a>

                    However, radiation-related myths can often not be busted (debunked) experimentally in the classroom. Therefore, students are expected to gather evidence from secondary sources to confirm or falsify their hypothesis/answer to their research question. By juxtaposing media/data sources and their content, students critically analyse their reliability and make justified conclusions based on the evidence found. As reliability assessment can be a real challenge for students, the material is supplied with a tool for searching and analysing the information. It would be good if the teacher could explain its use by demonstrating and analysing both reliable and less reliable sources as examples before the students implement this tool on their own.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                In order to communicate their findings, students are guided to produce a visual presentation of their conclusions <b>(Activity 4)</b>. Video could be an exciting option. For this purpose, students can use a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuC4DJElPQrOEMp2nLj1Q3h-_r8q7fzp0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video tutorial</a>. Also, student material is provided with criteria the video should fulfil when ready. These criteria can be used formatively for self-assessment during the process and peer assessment when presenting the video and answering the questions of their peers and the teacher <b>(Activity 5)</b>. Students can use the following <nuxt-link to="./tools/peer-feedback" target="_blank">assessment tool</nuxt-link> to give feedback to, or get it from, the other groups.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the last activity <b>(Activity 6)</b>, socially-acute issues related to ionising radiation and nuclear energy will be debated. Suggested debate role-play is presented in the student material. It can be adapted freely to a particular educational context. Teachers can decide what kind of assessment to use or not to encourage the free expression of students' ideas and arguments. Based on the lessons learned from the earlier stages, students can juxtapose and reflect on their science knowledge and personal and social values.
            </p>

            <p>
                We suggest using a specific topic, "Nuclear Power," currently focused on public attention and actively debated in many European countries. Almost every country has its own, more or less specific, "nuclear energy" debate. Teachers could encourage students to follow the debate in their own country. Often there are also apparent fears, misconceptions, and myths that could be identified related to this specific topic, such as….
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><b>Myth 1:</b> Nuclear energy is not safe.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 2:</b> Nuclear energy contributes to carbon emissions and thus leads to atmospheric pollution and global warming.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 3:</b> Nuclear waste needs to be stored for 100,000 years.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 4:</b> Nuclear plants emit dangerous amounts of radiation.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 5:</b> Radiation exposure only occurs from a nuclear power station.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 6:</b> We do not need nuclear power in the EU.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 7:</b> Nuclear plants are ageing and inefficient.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 8:</b> Nuclear power plants can explode.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 9:</b> Nuclear waste cannot be safely transported.</li>
                <li><b>Myth 10:</b> Nuclear plant workers are radioactive themselves.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Facts related to these myths about nuclear energy are presented in the <nuxt-link to="radiation/background">Scientific background information</nuxt-link>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Teachers should be aware of historical and social aspects leading to nuclear radiation fears. Some ideas related to this issue are also highlighted in the Scientific background information. There, teachers can get a quick overview of the science concepts and facts covered by the Radiation module and related areas that students can be curious about.
