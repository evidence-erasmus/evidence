        <h3>Activity 3b: Mythbusting based on secondary sources</h3>

        <p>In this activity, you are expected to:</p>
        <ul class="leading-tight">
            <li>Narrow down your myth into a <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/testable-hypothesis-explanation-and-examples-609100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testable hypothesis</a>/research question;</li>
            <li>plan your search for relevant information that will confirm or falsify your hypothesis / answer your research question;</li>
            <li>present collected data in the form of tables, graphs, or similar;</li>
            <li>assess the reliability of the gathered evidence;</li>
            <li>use your findings to draw a conclusion;</li>    
        </ul>
        
        <p>While doing this, you should think carefully about how to share the workload within your group. You could designate everybody to a different role, for example, to a leader who is organizing the activities, to a secretary who is making notes and comments about the information found, to an investigator who is doing searches, to a critic who is scrutinizing the reliability of the information.</p>
