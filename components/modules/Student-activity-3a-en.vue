        <h3>Activity 3a: Mythbusting based on  experiment</h3>

        <p>In case you think your myth can be tested experimentally, please read the following guidelines:</p>
        
        <h4>In this activity, you are expected to:</h4>
        <ul class="leading-tight">
            <li>Narrow down your myth into a <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/testable-hypothesis-explanation-and-examples-609100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testable hypothesis</a>/research question.</li>
            <li>Design an experiment that will confirm or falsify your hypothesis/ answer your research question.</li>
            <li>Present your collected data in tables and graphs, and preferably, videotape your experiment as evidence
                <br />

            <li>Explain your results using scientific evidence.</li>
            <li>Use your results to form a conclusion.</li>
            <li>Estimate the plausibility of the chosen myth.</li>
            <li>Share workload within your group (e.g., through designating everybody to a different role - manager, secretary, supplier of materials).</li>
