        <h1 class="font-Alfa font-normal">The Project</h1>

        <p>The frequent incident of pseudo-scientific information, conspiracy theories, and “alternative” facts in media is a new reality. Despite a modern raised level of education and standard of living, the number of people, adopting beliefs that are patently at odds with observable reality and scientific evidence, is a growing concern.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, most (science) teachers lack skills to tackle socially acute science related issues susceptible to controversies and social escalation in the classroom, many of which raised by students in the context of health.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the main aim of this project is to <b>create a relevant model for implementing EVIDENCE methodology, together with respective teaching-learning materials, that will contribute to the development of students’ key competences</b>, such as literacy, science, media, digital, and citizenship competence of both GE and VET schools, while addressing socially acute and sensitive science related issues within the context of medicine, healthcare, and the environment more generally.</p> 

        <h2>Objectives</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>To provide GE, VET and HE institutions with an innovative EVIDENCE methodology and respective learning materials for developing key competences through addressing socially acute and controversial science and health related issues. </li>
            <li>
                To make science learning more motivating and personally meaningful for diverse groups of students, including those with lack of interest and low academic achievement. 
            </li>
            <li>
                To raise involved teachers’, teacher educators’ and students’ awareness about the nature of demagogy, conspiracy theories, and pseudo-science and the nature of science. 
            </li>
            <li>
                To raise project teachers’ and teacher educators’ self-efficacy in using EVIVENCE approach and innovative teaching-learning methods, in classroom.
            </li>
            <li>
                To raise school level collaboration between different subject teachers in project schools and between the participating VET, HE, and GE institutions.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Intellectual output 1</h2>

        <p>The materials (six modules) are trying to address the lack of relevant teaching-learning materials able to address socially sensitive science related issues which could help teachers to manage newly raised post-truth challenges in the classroom as well as to develop students' key competences. The context of health was chosen as it provides a rich context for: (1) learning of important science concepts and skills plus key competences; (2) addressing and testing common myths, and the material can be easily integrated with national curricula (intended to be as complementary to curricular materials for the use in science, but also in social science or other lessons).</p>

        <h3>
            Target groups
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Students of general and vocational education schools, 15-18 years old.</li>
            <li>Science and social science teachers of general and vocational education schools.</li>
        </ul>
 
        <h3>
            Impact
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Increase students’ intrinsic motivation to learn, raise their key competences including their ability to make responsible health-related decisions;
            </li>
            <li>
                the materials/environment are helpful and user-friendly for students and teachers and make teachers feel they are able to implement modules in a confident manner;
            </li>
            <li>
                initiate further collaboration between the teachers of different subjects.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>
            Intellectual output 2
        </h2>

        <p>Based on the literature, many (science) teachers lack of skills to tackle socially acute science related issues in classroom. Therefore, a methodological guidebook is needed for teachers to understand how to meet "post-truth" challenges in education, and the nature of EVIDENCE approach.</p>

        <h3>
            Impact
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                awareness of educational community (teachers, parents, students, educational officials) in the challenges of “post-truth” reality for education and how these can be meaningfully addressed, will be raised;
            </li>
            <li>
                ability of teachers and teacher educator to implement EVIDENCE approach successfully in classroom (or within teacher training);
            </li>
            <li>
                through innovative methods explained, the book will increase the uptake of digital learning tools.
